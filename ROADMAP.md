## Learning Philosophy
This project follows a learn-as-you-go approach where skills are acquired when needed for specific tasks. The roadmap now includes three major learning tracks that build upon each other:

1. **Multi-Exchange Integration** - Building robust, scalable trading infrastructure
2. **Machine Learning** - Adding predictive capabilities and alpha generation
3. **FPGA Acceleration** - Achieving institutional-grade performance

Each milestone builds on previous work while introducing new challenges. The progression from single-exchange trading to ML-enhanced multi-exchange FPGA acceleration provides a comprehensive learning experience with regular achievements and measurable progress.

The integration of ML and multi-exchange functionality in Phase 1 ensures these capabilities are mature before FPGA acceleration, leading to a more robust final system.
